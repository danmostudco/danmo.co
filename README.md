## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

My portfolio has transformed over the years - initially it was just static HTML, then to Jekyll. After investing time in learning more React focused technologies (like Next.js), it made more sense to build my personal site in that world. This site functions as a homebase for me to write and showcase work.
