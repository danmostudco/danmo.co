# How I Journal

<Date>{meta.date}</Date>

![journal on a coffee table](/static/images/how-i-journal/coffee.jpg)

_This is part of a two post series on journaling. [Part 1](/notes/why-i-journal) discusses the benefits I have seen from journaling over the last decade, Part 2 discusses the process I have developed to reap those benefits._

In my last post, I described “[why I journal](/notes/why-i-journal),” an expanded list of emotional and psychological benefits I have found in over a decade of consistent journaling.

When people ask "how I journal," they often begin by inquiring if it’s pen and paper or word documents on my computer. The answer is a bit more complicated than that. I would divide my system into A) processes I adhere to and B) tools and techniques. For me personally I’ve applied what I suspect is a reasonably modern take on this old craft, integrating media, keywords, hyperlinks, and digital process to make my journal work in the information age. Here are some aspects I optimized for as my journal grew into a larger part of my life, which may not be obvious in their importance from the outset:

### Key Aspects for Process

-   **Frequency** - I aim to write about 3 - 5 times per week. Although this doesn’t always happen, I’ve found this is enough to serve my purposes without feeling too much pressure to be writing non-stop.
-   **Templating** - When I first started out, nothing was more intimidating than staring at a completely white screen and expected to start typing. Whatever primers I could put in were welcomed during my first few years.
-   **Internal vs External** - If possible, I try to write about how I felt at the time of an event, not what happened, both negative and positive. I’ve found this to be a key to using the journal as a place for growth and reflection.
-   **Placeholders** - I rely heavily on quick notes and markers to remind myself to go back and document something when I don’t have time in the moment to write, which is almost always. For example if I’m on a busy trip, I’ll leave a bullet point or a photo as a reminder to fill in thoughts on the plane ride home.

### Key Aspects for Tools

-   **Convenience** - I had to be able to capture thoughts from anywhere, anytime and access them ideally from any device
-   **Searchability** - To quickly access previous entries, I had to leave rich keywords and phrasing to allow for finding memories later on
-   **Skimmability** - Once I located an entry, I had to be able to find what I was looking for in quick glances, which meant placing a lot of visual markers in my journal in the form of photos and screenshots
-   **Hyperlinking** - My brain is a web of topics, therefore, my journal had to be able to link from entry to entry as to allow me jump around my own written thoughts, almost like a Wiki for my memories

All of this is achieved primarily in Evernote, but you could use your own tools whether it’s OneNote, Bear, or Google Docs.

## An Example: Putting It All Together

Before we get started, I thought I would give an example of how I generally go about constructing a journal entry. It’s a fairly loose process but involves leaving real-time, high-level markers for me to return to, where I then fill in what I hoped to capture from the memory.

![diagram of my process](/static/images/how-i-journal/basicprocess.png)

**Step 0:** Start a new note in Evernote.

**Step 1:** Over the course of a new entry being open, I will add a few markers to my journal - I try for at least 3 inside each entry as it gives a pretty adequate snapshot of that point in time. “Markers” can be pretty broad

-   Pictures are best: if I go to an event, I snap a photo of the event, if I’m at dinner with friends I grab a quick photo. Candids work great for this.
-   Screenshots are fine: clips of texts & emails, messages from work, calendar invites, articles I read.
-   Bullet points if necessary: If all else fails, I just leave a few bullet points with a thought to get back to... _“excited about booking tickets to see Ben,” “stressed about hitting X deadline”_

**Step 2:** Over the next few days, I will try to fill in a few paragraphs associated to the markers. Sometimes they are directly tied to the marker, like writing about my reactions to a specific place I visited on a trip. Other times they will be tangentially related to a marker, like writing about what was going on in the backdrop of my life during that same trip. As I get time at lunch, before I go to bed, over coffee in the morning, etc I will bang out a paragraph or two associated to each marker.

_The whole time horizon for writing a single entry can be a single day or it can be a whole week._ Total time for an entry is usually 15-60 minutes. Often times I have two or three journal entries in progress at any given time that I will return to markers and finish in a batch at a coffee shop or during a quiet, weekend morning. My best times to “close out” derelict journal entries is on planes and trains as I travel, which generally happens about once a month. Rather than play games on my phone, watch shows, or read - I prefer to write if I can.

With that high level picture described, here are the moving parts of the specific solution I have crafted for myself.

## Process: My Rules for the Road

With regards to the actual content of the message, I have found three key actions on my part help me get the most out of my journal: templates, writing about positives, write about my feelings.

![simple templates](/static/images/how-i-journal/templates.png)

### Use a Template

In my “marker” system above, I know generally what structure I am trying to achieve in each post - ideally three photos with three or more associated paragraphs. Anything more than that is icing on the cake; I have found such a system helps me [achieve many of the benefits I am striving for](www.danmo.co/posts/why-i-journal). If you can’t decide on your own system, many different journaling systems have proliferated over the years. I recommend you pick one and use that as a starting point, slowly layering in your own requirements or sections as you need. Here are two systems I can recommend having used them before:

-   [A gratitude journal](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gratitude_journal), which in its simplest form is 3 in-depth bullet points 3x per week. I started with this format very early on and found it a good way to brighten my mood and slow down life’s busyness.
-   The 5 minute journal has been making the rounds for a few years. It has a few sections you fill out each day to increase mindfulness like “I am grateful for…,” “what would make today great?”, “list three amazing things that happened today”, “what could I have done to make today better?” I created a template in Evernote of these questions that I would copy and paste into a note each day and fill out. If you don’t want to make your own, you can [purchase a hardcopy online](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal) as well.

After using these two systems to help get my thoughts flowing over a few years, I have since transitioned to more free-form writing. Structure and “training wheels” are incredibly helpful to get started.

![positives and negatives](/static/images/how-i-journal/layering.png)

### Lead with Positives, Then Layer on Negatives

The gratitude journal and the five minute journal both focus on positives, as I think any journal should. A journal can be a tome dedicated to a life lived intentionally with rich interactions and memories of those you love. I often get asked if I write about negatives, especially when I was using the gratitude or 5 minute formats. I initially focused on positives, and if my mind drifted to something darker I would then allow myself to write about negatives. But by forcing myself to first focus on positives, I was able to put the negatives in perspective before tackling them, rather than devolving into an angry rant (which can be good sometimes to get out of your system, but also destructive if it becomes habitual).

For example: if I had a long day of meetings with clients and the meetings went poorly, I may first write a gratitude about _getting through the day_ and showing some resilience despite a lackluster outcome. Perhaps some coworkers helped me along, perhaps I found some distractions to take the edge off the disappointment, perhaps I got a good workout in to release some tension afterward. Only after capturing this positive would I then jump into what had gone wrong, how that came about, what I or others had done to cause it, and more. By consistently leading with positives, I could feel my brain rewiring over time to scan my life for good outcomes worth being thankful for, as opposed to a default of focusing on bad ouctomes.

My advice would be to first build the habit of recording positives, and use your journal as a sort of “rainy day fund” in which to deposit memories. I have found tremendous joy on my lowest days flipping through write-ups of meals shared with friends, time spent with family, trips to amazing places, or quiet, contemplative coffees. Also, by having a diversity of gratitudes that you contribute to over time, you’ll train yourself to be more in the moment and appreciate those times worth celebrating in your journal. I often find myself stopping and realizing I’m actively enjoying something so much that I’ll want to write about it later - a useful trigger to ensure I am purposefully savoring the here and now, rather than just letting it pass me by.

It was after I mastered this skill of seeking positivity that I began to allow myself to drift further into negatives. Though the above isn’t a hard and fast rule, I found it to be the best mechanism to ensure my journal didn’t become a graveyard of lamentable diatribes. My thoughts became more responsible.

![feelings](/static/images/how-i-journal/feel.png)

### Write about how you feel, not what happened

For me journaling is foremost a contemplative exercise in which I think about who I’ve been, who I am, and where I am going. Thus, simply “recording” events as they happened makes for poor introspection and even worse reading as time goes on. Consider these two entries and which you would rather tuck away for later.

-   **What happened:** _"Ben and I went to Don Papa Grande for dinner, which was a lot of fun. We grabbed a few rounds of appetizers and recapped our couple rounds of bowling, talking about the various birthday parties we had at Holiday Bowl in our childhood. I told Ben about that time in third grade when my friend Cole dropped a bowling ball on my foot. We then laughed about when they used to have the cheap driving range out back.”_
-   **How you feel:** _“Ben and I went to Don Papa Grande for dinner, which despite having now travelled all over the world continues to be a location from my childhood that I cherish dearly. As I have developed over the years, it’s been interesting to see our old, local Mexican Restaurant become a constant in my life - from child to college student to young professional, always a place of laughter and reminiscence even as Ben and I grow and change. For example, in the same 10 minute span we revisited Cole dropping a bowling ball on my toe in third grade and discussed the ups and downs of his new job offer on the table; suggesting just how far we’ve come. It makes me wonder what other “timeless” places I have in my life and how I might create new ones as I grow older since they seem so rare. I find trips to Don Papa are like bookends to phases of my life; a standard format through I can converse and laugh and reflect on how I’ve changed. It’s odd to find such levels of introspection and timelessness not in a church or museum, but in a restaurant.”_

The first reads like a grocery list, and frankly is how I used to write in my gratitude and 5 minute journals. Only after coming back a few years later did I realize how little this helped me understand who I was at the time and what was on my mind. It was simply an unimaginative sequence of happenings. To correct this, I tried to get a bit more in my head on any given event… what was the significance and why did I choose this, of all things, to write about? I found the results to be much more illuminating and help me actually process events with greater fidelity than I previously was capable of.

Writing about how I feel usually doubles as tracking “what happened." Often to describe my feelings I have to dive into the sights, sounds, quotes, and interactions that drove the memory, so simply changing the aperture of the writing lens was enough to derive a richer entry with about the same in-the-moment detail.

## Tested Tools

To facilitate the above processes, I lean on a few critical tools. This is likely where my system diverges most from traditional journaling approaches because mine is highly digitized on purpose, affording me a great deal of benefits in accessing and finding memories. The core components are some form of cloud syncing, using images, and finding ways to link and search on entries.

![Devices with Evernote](/static/images/how-i-journal/devices.png)

### Evernote for Ubiquitous Entry

I have been using Evernote daily for journaling and task management since 2012. It’s a service I happily pay for on a yearly basis because of the enormous value it affords me in keeping all my thought-work in one place. The ability to sync across multiple devices is a lynchpin of my system, because it allows me to jot down notes no matter where I am and refine them later on. I start most journal entries on my phone with a marker while I am out and about, and later I will return on my laptop to flesh out the thoughts. Once more, the fact I can sync between a personal and a work laptop, or access entries in the browser, means I am never more than an internet connection away from working on my journal. I also can dabble in local copies on my machines if I am flying or traveling internationally without consistent access to the web.

Evernote is the primary enabler of the “marker” templating system I described above. I will often add a marker while I am actively at an event with friends (say, a photo from my phone of us on a hike), sync it to my account, and then write in my journal that evening before I go to bed. If I have a good conversation with my parents, I’ll take a screen shot of my phone’s call summary with their name as a visual marker and later write about what we discussed and how it made me feel.

It’s a bit like leaving myself breadcrumbs to follow home, I drop these markers throughout the day. I am constantly in a dance of pushing markers into notes, syncing devices, filling out entries based on those markers later on, and syncing again. If I’m on the subway that will happen on my phone, if I’m eating lunch on a weekday that will happen in the browser of my work computer, if I’m on a plane home that will happen on my personal laptop. Evernote’s syncing feature allows for this type of ubiquitous, light-touch journaling system to work.

![Three images](/static/images/how-i-journal/images.png)

### 3 photos per entry

I use my phone’s camera or laptop screen capture software to ensure I grab at least 3 photos per journal entry. This is helpful in two ways

-   They provide markers for me to return and fill in, providing those mental breadcrumbs of a post left unfinished
-   When entires are complete, they allow me to skim through notes and quickly recall the contents of that entry

I’m a tremendously visual thinker, so I often can remember a conversation or experience by thinking about the snapshot I took to remember that specific time. Therefore if I see a photo within a journal entry, I will remember generally what I wrote even without reading the one or two paragraphs of associated text. If I’m looking for something very specific, the associated mental “meta-data” images provide makes posts easily findable and skimmable.

An additional benefit, interestingly, is having photos entries tends to provide richer echos of long forgotten entries. I’ll see an apartment I used to live in, a person I used to hang out with, a meal I used to cook, or a place I have long since visited and I am immediately transported back to a very different time in my life. The words I wrote associated to these images take on new meaning because I feel like I’m poking into a portal, able to see the imagery alongside the words in my mind of a time since passed. The quality of the photos doesn’t matter, as long as they contain some key facets of that period in my life.

For example, I was looking for a conversation I knew I had written about on New Years Eve a few years back, but wasn’t quite sure which New Years Eve journal entry it was located in. Just by looking at the associated marker images of various New Years entries, I was able to quickly locate that memory by finding the one of a dinner party at my friend’s house, as opposed to other venues in years past. What could have been a twenty or thirty minute fact-finding mission took only two or three minutes of filtering by New Years journal entries and then looking at photos.

Perhaps for others photos aren’t a necessary part of their journals; I find it to be an enormously high value-add that takes very little time or effort on my part, making it a slam dunk of an addition.

![Entries linked to one another](/static/images/how-i-journal/hyperlinks.png)

### Hyperlinking and searching

Probably the most technical aspect of my journal is the wiki-style linking of entries to one another. Evernote and other digital note-taking tools enable the creation of internal links to other posts, allowing you to cross-link from entry to entry. This, combined with the ability to search on keywords to whittle down certain entries, makes my journal a place where I can easily find and access parts of my past I have written about. As someone who once kept a pen and paper journal, it’s a world-class improvement over boxes of old journals that are for the most part inaccessible and at times undecipherable.

I hyperlink across notes on a few dimensions. Here are a few to give you an idea:

-   _Events:_ For recurring events like holidays or birthdays, I will usually hyperlink to the last occurrence of that holiday. Then I can jump from Christmas 2017 to Christmas 2016, 2015 and so on when I go back and review.
-   _Individuals:_ If I write about an experience I had with an individual, I will sometimes link back to the last time I saw that person (I’ll identify that post by searching for their name). This way, I’m able to easily see the story of my relationship with a friend unfold over multiple entries.
-   _Trips:_ If I go on a trip to a location more than twice, I link the entries together. For example, in my visits to London to visit my friend Matt, I will link to the last time I was in the UK visiting, or each time I go to Ocean City, New Jersey with my friend Bill, I will link to the last time we spent time there.
-   _Story lines:_ If I write about a particular topic over and over again, I will sometimes note in my journal entry “last time I wrote about this…” and link to the previous entry. This can be regarding ongoing projects during an extended period, challenges I am trying to solve at work with continued developments, changes in my life that take weeks or months, etc.
-   _Themes:_ Sometimes themes develop in my thinking like how I feel about a certain social topic, my thoughts on an emerging technology, synthesizing data points on a broad, national conversation, or more philosophical points. I’ll try to connect these dots to track my thinking as it evolves over time.

On top of these hyperlinks, the most important thing to do is to ensure I am descriptive enough in my wording to ensure when I search for a particular memory, there is enough meat to locate the entry - almost like “memory SEO.” For example, the Washington Nationals recently competed in the World Series and I went to a watch party outside the stadium. I ensured my entry about that memory included “baseball,” “party,” “Washington Nationals,” “World Series” and more - as any of those terms will trigger a match. A week later, when I went to the Nationals Victory Parade in downtown DC, I hyperlinked back to the watch party memory to more closely tie those entries together. The end goal is to create a web of memories that I can jump around easily and arrive at adjacent thoughts.

## Tying it all together

At any given time, I’m using the above rules to juggle anywhere from 1 - 5 posts simultaneously. I'm adding markers as I can, syncing between my devices, filling in details when I get downtime to write, hyperlinking posts together, revising thoughts until I get a journal entry to “done.” Thus, my journal is very much a reflection of what I see as a natural thought process: ever in motion, evolving, and in flux.

![Staggered writing over a week](/static/images/how-i-journal/timeline.png)

There are a number of moving parts to this system; I have slowly added them over time and for the most part all of this is just habit that naturally occurs over the course of the week. For each concept I outlined here, I tried 4 or 5 alternatives to arrive at this as what works for me. For anyone trying to get into journaling, I’d recommend not putting too much judgement on yourself or your process, but instead see it as a laboratory for experimenting how you express yourself and refine the tool for the goals you have in mind. If you’re deliberate enough, you will begin to prune away behaviors that don’t work for you and replace them with hallmarks unique to your system.

In a world where so much of our personal lives are broadcast out through social media posts, group chats, and short pings on messenger apps; I’ve come to enjoy this internal thinking ecosystem I created. Rather than being a distraction of who I am, it helps me process events more clearly, live in the moment, and refine my thinking in a concerted manner. As I put it earlier, this is a modern take on an old craft. My hope in showing the messiness of the process is to possibly inspire others to embrace the messiness and jump in.
