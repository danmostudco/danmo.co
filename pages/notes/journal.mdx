# How I Journal

<Date>{meta.date}</Date>

In this post, I'll be exploring how I journal. Many people have asked me about the form and function of the journal, as it's the primary way by which I keep track of my life. I'll also be including a few code snippets.

```jsx
const thisIsANumber = {
    myNumber: 1,
    yourNumber: 2
};
```
