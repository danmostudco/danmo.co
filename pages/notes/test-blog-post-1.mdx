Dan is actively trying to recreate a next an [MDX blog](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/next/).
So I am actively seeing how to convert this into _"React Components"_. Slowy and steady.

> Here is an [example Github repo](https://github.com/messa/nextjs-mdx-blog-example), which has some starting points to draw from.
I'll need to figure out the build scripts.
Going to leave this here until I can port over my older posts and get everything clicking.
